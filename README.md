# NER-WITH-BERT
The objective of this project is to develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using BERT, a state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer model, and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The NER system will be able to extract and classify entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) from unstructured text data.
